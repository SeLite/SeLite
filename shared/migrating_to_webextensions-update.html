    <title>SeLite needs your influence</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>Thank you for having installed SeLite with previous version of Firefox. However, new Firefox doesn't support SeLite, unfortunately.
    </p>
    <p>Migration to new Firefox and new Selenium IDE is in progress, but difficult. The developer of SeLite is overwhelmed. This work depends on third parties. You could influence them by voting on related requests. <a href="https://github.com/peter-kehl">Get in touch</a>, please.
